    gettingStartedContent: `Your goal is to explore, survive, and shape your own story.
- **Movement:** Use the arrow controls or 'W, A, S, D' keys to move between areas.
- **Actions:** Use the buttons on the right panel for common actions like checking your status or crafting.
- **Custom Actions:** The AI Storyteller is your guide. Type anything you can imagine into the action box at the bottom right. Try to "search for hidden clues", "climb a tree to get a better view", or "try to reason with the goblin". Be creative!`,
    uiTitle: "The Interface",
    uiContent: `- **Left Panel:** This is your story log. Everything that happens is recorded here.
- **Right Panel:** Your control hub.
  - **Minimap:** Shows your immediate surroundings. Click it to view a larger world map.
  - **Status (Shield Icon):** Check your stats, skills, equipment, quests, and read your journal.
  - **Inventory (Backpack Icon):** Manage your items. Click on an item to see what you can do with it.
  - **Crafting (Hammer Icon):** Combine materials to create new tools, weapons, and other supplies. The system will automatically use the best alternative ingredients if you have them.
  - **Building (House Icon):** Construct shelters and other structures to aid your survival.
  - **Fusion (Flask Icon):** Experiment by fusing 2-3 items. You might create something powerful... or just a pile of junk.`,
    combatTitle: "Combat & Skills",
    combatContent: `- **Attacking:** Use the Sword button to attack an enemy in your current location.
- **Dice Rolls:** All major actions (combat, skills, etc.) involve a dice roll (d20 by default). The result determines the level of success, from Critical Failure to Critical Success.
- **Skills:** As you perform actions (moving, fighting), you will unlock new skills. Use them from the right panel. They cost Mana (the blue bar).
- **Taming:** Some creatures are not hostile. Try giving them their favorite food from your inventory to tame them as companions.`,
    craftingBuildTitle: "Crafting & Building",
    craftingBuildContent: `- **Crafting:** Collect materials to create items. The crafting window shows what you can make. If an ingredient is yellow, it means the system is using a substitute you have. The tooltip will show all possible substitutes.
- **Building:** Use materials to build helpful structures like Campfires for warmth or Shelters for resting.
- **Fusion:** The Fusion Altar is for pure experimentation. The results depend on the items, the environment, and a bit of luck!`,
    survivalTitle: "Survival & Story",
    survivalContent: `- **Core Stats:** Manage your Health (HP, red), Mana (for skills, blue), and Stamina (for physical actions, orange). Stamina and Mana regenerate slowly over time.
- **Body Temperature:** The environment and weather affect your body temperature. If it gets too high or low, it will drain your stamina and eventually your health. Build a fire or find shelter to regulate it.
- **Journal:** At the start of each new day, the AI will write a journal entry from your perspective, summarizing your previous day's adventures. Check it in the Status window.`,
    customActionsTitle: "Your Imagination is the Limit",
    customActionsContent: `This game's heart is the AI Storyteller. You are not limited to the buttons.
- **Be Creative:** Type anything into the custom action box. Try to "search the ruins for treasure," "build a trap," or "try to intimidate the goblin."
- **AI Interpretation:** The AI will interpret your action and determine the outcome, using the game's rules as a guide. The more descriptive you are, the more interesting the results can be!`,
